## How to use it?
As you can see, there is four files on the repository. There is a readme.md file, not important. One is a .exe file, </p>
to run it on windows. There is also a .jar, to run it on every OS with java (8+)</p>
installed. And there is a .java, to see the raw code. This is not an executable.</p>

### Run the .exe (windows)
To run the .exe file (only for windows), you simply have to double-click on it.</p>
Java 8+ is requiered, but if you don't have the right version, the program </p>
automatically install it. If there is a pop-up, just click "Ok".

### Run the .jar (every OS, java 8+ requierd)
To run the .jar, you need to open a terminal on the folder where the .jar file is </p>
and type:</p>

```
$ java -jar loveGuesser.jar
```
